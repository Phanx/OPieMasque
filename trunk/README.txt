OPie Masque
==============

Adds Masque skinning support to OPie.

OPie dropped built-in Masque support in version Lime 1. This plugin
restores it. Obviously, you must have both Masque and OPie installed.
There are no options^. Just install it, and you will once again be able
to use Masque to skin OPie.

Also, you will be able to modify the numeric cooldown text using OmniCC
(and if you don't have OmniCC or something like it installed, you won't
see numeric cooldown text at all).

^ There is now one option, for controlling the visiblity of OPie's color
highlighting, because some Masque skins have really ugly "highlight"
textures. If you don't like how the color highlight looks, open the
Addon.lua file in Notepad and edit the value of the SPECIAL_COLOR_ALPHA
variable at the top. A value of 0 will completely hide the coloring, 1
will make it fully visible, and anything in between (eg. 0.5) will make
it partly transparent.
